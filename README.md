- View detailed information for each trip  
- Add/remove trips from **favorites**  
- Clean and responsive UI using Flutter widgets

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**  
- **Dart**  
- Widgets: `Scaffold`, `Drawer`, `GridView`, `Stack`, `ListView`  
- Local state management & data filtering logic

Notes

> The app is not 100% complete — it's a learning project, and I'm continuously improving it.
Also, animation was added using pre-made assets (not built from scratch), just to give the UI a nice touch!
